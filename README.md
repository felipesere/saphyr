# Saphyr libraries

This repository is home to `saphyr-parser`, `saphyr` and soon-to-be
`saphyr-serde`. These crates provide fully YAML 1.2 compliant parsing and
manipulation, with a focus on correctness, performance and API friendliness (in that order).

[`saphyr`](https://docs.rs/saphyr/latest/saphyr/) is the most user-friendly and
high-level crate, providing quick-and-easy YAML importing, exporting and object
manipulation.

```rs
use saphyr::{LoadableYamlNode, Yaml, YamlEmitter};

let docs = Yaml::load_from_str("[1, 2, 3]").unwrap();
let doc = &docs[0]; // select the first YAML document
assert_eq!(doc[0].as_integer().unwrap(), 1); // access elements by index

let mut out_str = String::new();
let mut emitter = YamlEmitter::new(&mut out_str);
emitter.dump(doc).unwrap(); // dump the YAML object to a String
```

---

[`saphyr-parser`](https://docs.rs/saphyr-parser/latest/saphyr_parser/) is the
parser behind `saphyr`. It provides direct access to the parsing process by
emitting [YAML
events](https://docs.rs/saphyr-parser/latest/saphyr_parser/parser/enum.Event.html).
It does not include YAML to object mapping, but is a lightweight alternative to
`saphyr` for those interested in building directly atop the parser, without
having an intermediate conversion to a Rust object. More details on where to
start are available [on
doc.rs](https://docs.rs/saphyr-parser/latest/saphyr_parser/parser/trait.EventReceiver.html).

```rs
/// Sink of events. Collects them into an array.
struct EventSink {
    events: Vec<Event>,
}

/// Implement `on_event`, pushing into `self.events`.
impl EventReceiver for EventSink {
    fn on_event(&mut self, ev: Event) {
        self.events.push(ev);
    }
}

/// Load events from a yaml string.
fn str_to_events(yaml: &str) -> Vec<Event> {
    let mut sink = EventSink { events: Vec::new() };
    let mut parser = Parser::new_from_str(yaml);
    // Load events using our sink as the receiver.
    parser.load(&mut sink, true).unwrap();
    sink.events
}
```

## Specification Compliance

This implementation is fully compatible with the YAML 1.2 specification.
`saphyr-parser`) tests against (and passes) the [YAML test
suite](https://github.com/yaml/yaml-test-suite/).

## License

Sets of licences are available for each of the crates. Due to this project
being based on a fork of [chyh1990's
`yaml-rust`](https://github.com/chyh1990/yaml-rust), there are 2 licenses to be
